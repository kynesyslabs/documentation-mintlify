The Demos Network primarily consists of two main parts, divided into the repositories `sdks` and `node`.

The `sdks` repository includes types, methods, and interfaces that are used in both the frontend and backend. Within it, you will find most of the methods required to interact with the Demos Network from within a dApp, as well as those needed to build a custom client. For a more detailed explanation of the `sdks` repository, please refer to [Link to section] .

The `node` repository contains the official implementation of Demos Network specifications for a backend client, commonly known as a node. Nodes form the core of the Demos Network and can function either as validators or simply as synced nodes. Each node includes all the features outlined in [Link to section].
