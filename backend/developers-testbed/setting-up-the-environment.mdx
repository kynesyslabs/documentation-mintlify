# Setting up the environment

Running a Demos node requires **Bun**.
Almost any OS and platform is supported, as long as it runs **Bun ≥ 1.2.7**.

You can install Bun by following the instructions at [https://bun.sh/docs/installation](https://bun.sh/docs/installation).

After installation, make sure Bun is correctly added to your system path by running:

`bun -v`

If you see the version number, you're good to go.
