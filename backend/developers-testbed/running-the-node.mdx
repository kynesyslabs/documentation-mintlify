# Running the node

If you made it this far, you're just one step away from running your very own Demos node!

---

#### Running a Node (Normal Mode)

To start a Demos node, simply run:

`./run`

This will also spin up a Postgres container alongside the node.
If you stop the node (e.g., with `CTRL+C` or due to a crash), the Postgres container will shut down too.
Restarting the node with `./run` will reuse the existing database and continue from where it left off.

---

#### Cleaning Up at Start

To force a full reset of the database, use:

`./run -c true`

This will wipe the Postgres container and restart the database from scratch.

> **Note**: This resets the entire blockchain.
>
> * If you're connected to other peers, your node will resync from them.
> * If you're running solo, the blockchain will restart from the genesis block.

### Other options for the run file
