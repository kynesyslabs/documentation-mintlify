#### Complexity in Implementation

* **Response:** While implementing dynamic shard composition and BFT mechanisms may require sophisticated technology, the benefits far outweigh the complexities. The enhanced security, scalability, and efficiency provided by PoR-BFT are crucial for the long-term success of cryptocurrency networks.

#### Potential for Node Manipulation

* **Response:** Continuous evaluation of nodes based on pseudorandom seed verification ensures that compromised nodes are identified and excluded from the network. This rigorous approach maintains the integrity of the blockchain system through robust cryptographic algorithms and continuous node audits.
