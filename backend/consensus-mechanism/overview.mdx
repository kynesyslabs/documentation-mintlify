# Consensus Mechanism

The landscape of blockchain technology is poised for transformation to achieve widespread adoption and growth. Traditional consensus mechanisms fall short in terms of scalability, security, and efficiency. The Proof of Reputation (PoR) Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PoR-BFT) framework, through its innovative consensus mechanism, aims to address these challenges by providing a more robust and adaptable solution.
