### Comparative Advantage

#### Proof of Work (PoW)

**Why:** PoW blockchains like Bitcoin are energy-intensive and prone to mining concentration.

* **Example:** The high energy consumption of Bitcoin mining raises environmental concerns, contributing significantly to carbon emissions. According to the University of Cambridge's Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index, Bitcoin’s annual energy consumption is comparable to that of a small country.

#### Proof of Stake (PoS)

**Why:** While PoS is energy-efficient, it can lead to centralization risks where validators with larger stakes control the network.

* **Example:** Ethereum 2.0’s transition to PoS has faced criticism for potential wealth concentration among large stakeholders due to increased incentives for large validators.

#### Proof of Authority (PoA)

**Why:** PoA relies on fixed, trusted nodes which can limit flexibility and dynamism in network participation.

* **Example:** A private blockchain using PoA for enterprise use might suffer from reduced adaptability during peak usage periods. PoR-BFT’s dynamic shard composition adds an additional layer of flexibility by rotating nodes within each shard mathematically to ensure balanced resource utilization through pseudorandom seeds.

#### EVM-based Consensus

**Why:** EVM-based systems like Ethereum have inherent computational overhead leading to high gas fees.

* **Example:** A cryptocurrency dApp on Ethereum might face expensive gas costs for transactions, limiting its widespread adoption. PoR-BFT’s efficiency reduces these costs significantly.
