# Global Change Registry

As the blockchain expands, storing all required information in each block to compute the current state of the blockchain becomes impractical. To address this issue, we have introduced a mechanism known as the Global Change Registry (GCR), as detailed in our yellow paper.

The GCR acts as a trusted, shared reference point for the blockchain's state. After synchronization of all blocks, it allows for quick retrieval, setting, and manipulation of account and subnet properties while maintaining both consistency and security.
