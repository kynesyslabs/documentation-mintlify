# Cross Chain

The cross chain (XM) SDKs help you create payloads to interact with other blockchains from DEMOS. These SDKs are divided into 2:

1. Web SDKs - For use in a browser environment
2. Local SDKs - For use in a Node JS environment

Under the hood, both these SDKs extend a core SDK that contains common functionality.

### Supported Blockchains

Here is a list of blockchains supported by DEMOS:

1. [EVM networks (Ethereum, etc)](/sdk/cross-chain/evm)
2. [MultiversX](/sdk/cross-chain/multiversx-egld)
3. [Solana](/sdk/cross-chain/solana)
4. [IBC networks](/sdk/cross-chain/ibc)
5. Bitcoin
6. [TEN.xyz](/sdk/cross-chain/ten)
7. [TON](/sdk/cross-chain/ton)
8. [XRPL](/sdk/cross-chain/xrpl)
9. [NEAR](/sdk/cross-chain/near)
10. Sui
11. Aptos
