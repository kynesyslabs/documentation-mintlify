# L2PS SDK

The L2PS module in the WebSDK provides a complete toolkit for **private transactions** on the Demos Network. Transactions are encrypted client-side using **AES-256** before being sent to L2PS-participating nodes.

## Key Features

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Client-Side Encryption" icon="lock">
    Transactions encrypted in your browser with AES-256-CBC before transmission.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Authenticated History" icon="key">
    Only address owners can access their transaction history via signatures.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Transaction Lifecycle" icon="arrows-rotate">
    Track transactions through Executed → Batched → Confirmed stages.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Simple Integration" icon="plug">
    Drop-in replacement for standard L1 transactions with privacy.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Generate Keys">
    Initialize L2PS module with shared AES key and IV matching the L2PS network.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Encrypt Transaction">
    SDK encrypts your transaction data client-side before sending.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Send to Network">
    Encrypted blob sent to L2PS node which decrypts and validates.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Track Status">
    Monitor transaction through executed → batched → confirmed lifecycle.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Transaction Lifecycle

| Status | Description | Timing |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| **Executed** | Node validated, balance reserved | Instant |
| **Batched** | Included in L1 batch with ZK proof | Per L1 block |
| **Confirmed** | L1 block finalized | Final |

## Quick Reference

```typescript
import { L2PSEncryption, L2PSService } from '@kynesyslabs/demosdk/l2ps'

// Initialize with L2PS network keys
const l2ps = new L2PSEncryption(aesKey, iv)

// Encrypt and send transaction
const encrypted = l2ps.encrypt({
  type: "native",
  from: "0xSender...",
  to: "0xRecipient...",
  amount: 10
})

// Send to L2PS network
const result = await L2PSService.sendTransaction(
  nodeUrl,
  l2psUid,
  encrypted,
  signature
)
```
