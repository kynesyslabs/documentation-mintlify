# L2PS SDK

The L2PS module in the WebSDK simplifies the process for developers to handle, link, and engage with L2PS Subnets within the Demos Network.

You can reference [l2ps-subnet-framework](../../../backend/l2ps-subnet-framework/) to learn how Subnets work within the Demos Network.

In this chapter, we will focus on the L2PS class as exposed by the SDK in the `l2ps`module.
