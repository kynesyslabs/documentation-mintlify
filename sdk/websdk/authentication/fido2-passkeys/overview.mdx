# FIDO2 Passkeys

The Demos SDK offers secure methods to generate or recover private keys using a FIDO2 hardware key, which are then usable across the entire Demos network, encompassing various contexts like different blockchains and traditional web2 environments.

In this chapter, we'll delve into the specifics of how this mechanism operates and strategies to utilize it effectively for optimal security.

### The `hmywallet` module and it's wrapper

The Demos SDK features a Python module called `hmywallet`, a customized version of [https://github.com/tcsenpai/hmywallet](https://github.com/tcsenpai/hmywallet) designed specifically for integration with the Demos SDK.

The code resides in `sdks/src/wallet/passkeys/hmywallet`, and the module for integrating it into the SDK can be found in `sdks/src/wallet/passkeys/passkeys.ts`.

### Usage and typical use cases

You can test the functionality of the wrapper by executing:

```bash
tsx src/wallet/passkeys/passkeys.ts
```

From the `sdks` repository root.

The test part of the module "just" creates the credentials and print out the private key generated.
However, the intended usage is:

```typescript
import wallet from "@kynesyslabs/demosdk"

[...]

const privateKey = await wallet.generatePasskey()
```

This method returns a hexadecimal string containing the private key linked to the credentials derived from your FIDO2 device's `hmac_secret`.

You can now use this private key in any way Demos allows it to be used. For example, you could load your Demos credentials directly using this private key.
