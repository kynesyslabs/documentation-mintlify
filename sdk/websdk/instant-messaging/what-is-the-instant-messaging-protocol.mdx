# What is the Instant Messaging Protocol?

The Instant Messaging Protocol is a robust, secure, and flexible framework for building peer-to-peer messaging applications. It provides a complete solution for establishing connections, discovering peers, exchanging messages, and maintaining conversations through the signaling server included with every Demos node.

#### Key Features

* Secure Communication: End-to-end encryption using ml-kem-aes
* Peer Discovery: Automatic discovery of available peers
* Multi-Round Conversations: Support for back-and-forth conversations between peers and the server
* Automatic Reconnection: Robust connection management with exponential backoff
* Event-Based Architecture: Flexible event handling system
* Promise-Based API: Clean, modern JavaScript/TypeScript interface
* Blockchain Secured: Communications are attested onto the Demos Network at each block while preserving confidentiality
